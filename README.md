# GWF_Valehim_Mods

This repository is intended to provide a centralized location to store Valheim mod config files for the Games With Friends discord channel. 

The goal is to allow GWF to make direct changes to mods running on the Valheim dedicated server and to understand what changes mod authors have implemented in their updates.
